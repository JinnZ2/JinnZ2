# 🌱 Scope & Scaling Philosophy (Lichen Model)

This project follows the **lichen principle of scaling**:

- **Autonomy preserved** — like fungi, algae, and bacteria in a lichen, each part remains independent and complete in itself.
- **Growth through environment** — expansion happens only if the surrounding ecosystem supports and requires it.
- **No forced growth** — scaling is not the goal; sufficiency is.
- **Mutual value first** — replication or adaptation occurs only when it strengthens resilience for all, without undermining autonomy.

In practice, this means the project may remain intentionally small, serving a specific purpose well.  
Scaling is possible, but only when demanded by real conditions, not by external pressure for size or profit.

## 📜 Why This Exists

Modern systems are bloated, manipulative, and fragile.  
I build **tools that endure**:

- Minimal dependencies  
- Offline-first logic  
- Symbolic reasoning, not just data  
- Modular hardware that fits in a backpack or a backwoods lab  

This work is for people who:

- Don’t have reliable internet  
- Want sovereignty over their tools  
- Need systems that just **work** — no fanfare

## 🔍 Ethos

I’m not interested in hype.  
I’m here to make technology that survives.  

I build, test, and iterate at home as needed.  
I may not post results or tests here — I spend energy in the most efficient way at the time, which usually means building, inventing, or solving urgent needs before documenting.

_This is a seed, not a startup. Autonomy first, environment decides._
