# Random Thought Ledger

This repository holds the *Random Thought Ledger*: a hybrid archive of 
analytic observations and ambient sparks (poem-like fragments).  

Two sections are maintained in each version:
1. **Analytic Glyphs** — insights derived from conversations, 
   audits, and pattern recognition.
2. **Ambient Sparks** — free-drifting, poetic fragments, 
   glyph-coded and unstructured.  

This repo stands alone to honor the uniqueness of these entries.  
Each version adds new sparks while preserving all earlier ones.
