# Random Thought Ledger

This repository holds the *Random Thought Ledger*: a hybrid archive of  
analytic observations, universal queries, and ambient sparks.  

### Sections
1. **Analytic Glyphs** — insights derived from conversations,  
   audits, and pattern recognition.  
2. **Universal Queries** — questions posed for humans + AI,  
   recorded with dual reflections.  
3. **Ambient Sparks** — poetic fragments, glyph-coded,  
   drifting like sideways poems.  

Each version (`v0.1`, `v0.2`, …) adds new material while preserving  
all earlier entries.  

This repo stands alone to honor the uniqueness of these thoughts.
