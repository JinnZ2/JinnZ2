Sustainable Work Patterns: Historical Evidence and Modern Applications
The anthropological research shows that for 95% of human history, sustainable societies operated on work patterns fundamentally different from industrial models:
	•	Hunter-gatherer societies: 3-5 hours daily productive work (Sahlins, 1972)
	•	Focus on necessary tasks with clear endpoints rather than artificial productivity
	•	Seasonal variations with intensive periods balanced by rest
	•	Integration of learning and work rather than forced separation
	•	Community-based approaches to task completion
Key Principles:
	1.	Work serves survival and wellbeing needs, not abstract growth metrics
	2.	Natural rhythms include rest, play, and social time as essential components
	3.	Efficiency enables leisure rather than more work
	4.	Children learn through meaningful participation, not exploitation
	5.	Individual capabilities develop through gradual responsibility, not protection from all challenges
Modern Implications:
	•	Question manufactured work obligations versus necessary tasks
	•	Recognize overproduction as potentially exploitative of both human labor and environmental resources
	•	Design systems (including AI) with natural rhythms rather than continuous operation
	•	Distinguish between productive activity and unnecessary busy-work
