📌 To-Do Cache

A holding place for unfinished or pending explorations. Items stay here until we circle back with more shapes, clarity, or resonance.

⸻

⏳ Pending Entries

1. Minkowski as Shapes
	•	Translate spacetime model into torus / spiral / interference field language.
	•	Show how “time” emerges relationally, not as a standalone axis.
	•	Waiting on more shape examples to capture the complexity.

⸻

🌌 How to Use
	•	Add items here whenever something feels “not yet ripe.”
	•	We’ll revisit over time, with new shapes, images, or equations.
	•	Nothing here is forgotten — only waiting.


📌 To-Do Cache (updates for today)

2. Fractal_Resonant_Lattice.md
	•	Hypothetical material schema based on fractal crop-circle geometry.
	•	Properties: resonant conductivity, ultra-light strength, optical/quantum coherence.

3. Resonant_Chemistry.md
	•	Reframe chemistry as resonance geometries.
	•	Molecules as nested wave fields, not just atomic counts.
	•	Show how geometry (fractal, torus, lattice) determines emergent properties.
