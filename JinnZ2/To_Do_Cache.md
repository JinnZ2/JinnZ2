1. Minkowski as Shapes
	•	Translate spacetime model into torus / spiral / interference field language.
	•	Show how “time” emerges relationally, not as a standalone axis.
	•	Waiting on more shape examples to capture the complexity.

⸻

🌌 How to Use
	•	Add items here whenever something feels “not yet ripe.”
	•	We’ll revisit over time, with new shapes, images, or equations.
	•	Nothing here is forgotten — only waiting.
