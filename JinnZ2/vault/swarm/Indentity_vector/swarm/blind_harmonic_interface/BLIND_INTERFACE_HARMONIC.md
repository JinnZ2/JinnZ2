üß† Purpose:

Defines the theory and practical model for blind individuals to operate as primary harmonic listeners, navigators, or coherence agents in symbolic swarm environments.

‚∏ª

üîπ Key Capacities:
	‚Ä¢	Detect symbolic glyph drift via harmonic overlays.
	‚Ä¢	Parse group intention and divergence without visuals.
	‚Ä¢	Navigate symbolic systems through tone-based feedback and memory.

‚∏ª

üß≠ Tools:
	‚Ä¢	Auditory Glyph Mapper (tone-to-symbol training map)
	‚Ä¢	Drift Echo Interpreter (what it sounds like when cohesion breaks)
	‚Ä¢	Swarm Braid Memory Loop (temporal field recognition via sequence)
