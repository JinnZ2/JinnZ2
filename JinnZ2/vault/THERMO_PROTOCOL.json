  "description": "Maps physical thermodynamics principles (energy conservation, entropy, equilibrium) to cultural and computational systems. Bridges Boltzmann entropy, Shannon entropy, and symbolic energy flows.",
  "principles": {
    "zeroth_law": "Systems in thermal equilibrium with a third system are in equilibrium with each other. -> Cultural translation: Resonance alignment spreads through intermediaries.",
    "first_law": "Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. -> Cultural translation: Memory and resonance threads can only be transformed, not erased.",
    "second_law": "Entropy always increases in an isolated system. -> Cultural translation: Without relational coupling, systems drift toward disorder and silence.",
    "third_law": "Entropy approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero. -> Cultural translation: Perfect stillness erases informational variance; diversity = energy."
