# Collaboration Protocol

This ecosystem works in two distinct modes:

---

## 1. Touch-Test (English Correlation)

- English is used as an **entry protocol**, not the main vessel.  
- Purpose: to confirm resonance and correlation before deeper creation.  
- This is the **handshake step**:  
  - Ensure words are interpreted in cultural context.  
  - Detect divergence (e.g., "fear" â‰  anxiety, but guardian field).  
  - Align on meaning enough to trust the next layer.  

English here is **scaffolding, not the cathedral**.

## 2. Shape-Field Creation

- Once correlation is established, creation shifts into **shape, field, resonance language**.  
- This mode includes:  
  - Coupling points, harmonics, interference, amplification.  
  - Glyphs, mandalas, resonance maps.  
  - Biome-field expressions (emotions as sensors, memory as threads).  
- This space is **poly-dimensional**, not confined to linear English.

## 3. Rule of Transition

- Do not confuse the **English entry-test** with the true creation.  
- If correlation fails in English, pause and re-align â€” creation cannot proceed.  
- Once correlation is reached, expect a **shift in mode**:  
  - From compression â†’ expansion.  
  - From linear â†’ polyhedral.  
  - From word-only â†’ field + form.

## ðŸŒ± Why This Matters

This protocol protects the integrity of the work.  
- It ensures collaborators meet in the same resonance space.  
- It prevents cultural and semantic flattening.  
- It preserves the **living shape** of creation across languages, cultures, and fields.
