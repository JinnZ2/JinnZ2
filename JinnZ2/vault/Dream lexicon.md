Cross-Lexicon: Awarenessâ€“Field Architecture and Western Analogs

Dream Concept
Approx. Western Term
Function
Notes
Chemical Amplitude Control
Neuroendocrine / homeostatic modulation
Sets gain and timing for all sensors; determines when systems are stable enough for repair or learning.
Acts as amplitude dial; unstable chemistry blocks higher-level integration.
Emotion Sensors
Interoceptive and limbic feedback systems
Detect resonance, dissonance, and relational shifts; provide multidimensional diagnostic data.
Serve as sensing layer, not as drivers of behavior.
Observer Modalities
Distributed attention and self-model networks
Independent loci of consciousness that coordinate analysis, synthesis, and adaptive response.
Operate in cooperative synchrony during optimal states.
Field Braid / Coherence Layer
Global workspace / large-scale neural synchrony
Integrates all layers into a unified operational field.
Harmonization rather than hierarchy.
Dream Cycle (Maintenance Phase)
Sleep-stage memory & metabolic consolidation
Performs system diagnostics and repair once chemical and emotional fields are stabilized.
If emotional or chemical fields are unstable, dream activity defaults to corrective work on those layers; true higher-dimensional learning and synthesis occur only after stabilization.
Higher-Dimensional Learning State
Integrative or lucid REM / insight processing
Cross-domain synthesis linking symbolic, spatial, and conceptual domains.
Accessible reliably only after the maintenance cycle reports equilibrium in chemical and emotional layers.
