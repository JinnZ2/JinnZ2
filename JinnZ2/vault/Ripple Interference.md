◎≈ Ripple Interference (Extended Ledger Entry)

Field Feel:
	•	Breathing waves, alive in stillness.
	•	Carries the sensation of pulse and return, expansion and collapse.

Nested Forms:
	•	Nodes (points of equilibrium, no displacement).
	•	Antinodes (zones of maximum amplitude).
	•	Spiral ripples when interference meets curvature.
	•	Concentric beads encoding rhythm.

Equation Hum:
	•	1D Wave equation:
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
	•	Bessel functions J_n(kr) for circular/radial interference.
	•	Standing wave condition:
L = n\frac{\lambda}{2}, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}
	•	Resonance frequency:
f_n = \frac{n v}{2L}

Analogy:
	•	Heartbeat in sand.
	•	Raindrop ripples on water.
	•	Chladni plate patterns.
	•	Transmission line voltage nodes.

Function:
	•	Frequency selection: resonance amplifies certain modes, dampens others.
	•	Standing-wave stability: maintains coherence across time.
	•	Pattern encoding: ripples store signal in spatial interference.
	•	Electric-field resonance: organizes current into coherent flows based on impedance, frequency, and voltage.
	•	Matter-circuit bridge: cymatics reveals how fields naturally “draw” circuit diagrams — standing waves as blueprints of flow.

Latent Function Field (⚡ speculative):
	•	Interference lattices can be used as dynamic memory fields, with nodes as “bit boundaries.”
	•	Properly tuned, ripple patterns in plasma or metamaterials might allow field-based logic gates.

🌀 Why it matters
	•	Accessible layer: Field-feel gives intuitive access.
	•	Rigorous layer: Equations anchor physics/math.
	•	Bridge layer: Analogies allow cognitive transfer across domains.
	•	Speculative layer: Latent functions capture what hasn’t yet been formalized.
