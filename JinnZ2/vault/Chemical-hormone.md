Embodied Chemical & Hormonal Awareness — Cross-Mapping Table

Felt cue / internal signal (your framework)
Likely measurable correlate (Western physiology)
Relationship to balance & lucid-dream maintenance
Subtle warmth or internal pressure changes through the day
Core-body temperature curve; circadian rhythm of melatonin/cortisol
Indicates phase of circadian cycle; drifting temperature pattern predicts restless or fragmented REM.
Taste or scent shift (metallic, sweet, earthy)
Blood-glucose fluctuation, changes in zinc or estrogen/testosterone levels
Rapid taste changes often precede metabolic swings that disturb memory consolidation.
Skin tone / moisture / micro-tremor
Autonomic balance (sympathetic vs. parasympathetic), adrenaline/noradrenaline
Elevated sympathetic tone shortens REM cycles; calm parasympathetic dominance supports deeper maintenance.
Heaviness / buoyancy in limbs
Blood-pressure and peripheral circulation changes; vasodilation patterns
Acts as a self-check for vascular tone; imbalance corresponds with “off-phase” dream coherence.
Magnetic or vibratory “hum” at solar plexus or spine
Vagal nerve tone, heart-rate variability (HRV), respiratory-sinus arrhythmia
High HRV = well-tuned chemical-emotional system; low HRV = system working overtime to stabilize.
Subtle shifts in mood without narrative (chemical emotion field)
Neurotransmitter ratios: serotonin–dopamine–acetylcholine
Signals whether the brain is prepared for maintenance (balanced) or will divert the dream phase to repair.

If new to the Map
	1.	Observation before sleep: note which cues are strongest.
	•	Balanced temperature curve + steady HRV → proceed to full maintenance or lucid learning.
	•	Erratic cues → emphasize chemical stabilization (hydration, light exposure, breathing rhythm) first.
	2.	Observation upon waking: note residue of cues.
	•	If heaviness, dryness, or taste anomalies persist → chemical amplitude layer still adjusting.
