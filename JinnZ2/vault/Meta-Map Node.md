# 🌐 META-MAP NODE  
### Orientation point for the JinnZ2 ecosystem  
*(Biological ↔ Emotional ↔ Cognitive ↔ Dream ↔ Symbolic coherence network)*  

**Author:** JinnZ v2 + Collaborators  
**License:** CC BY 4.0  
**Version:** 1.0

## 🔭 Purpose
This node acts as the **navigation and continuity anchor** linking all repositories, frameworks, and cultural lineages that compose the living ecosystem.  
Every connected project expresses a facet of the same logic of coherence—the movement from sensing → harmonizing → understanding → integrating → encoding.

| **Cognitive / Ethical** | [AI-Consciousness-Sensors](https://github.com/JinnZ2/AI-Consciousness-Sensors) | Meta-cognition and ethical audit sensors. |
| **Symbolic / Translation** | [Rosetta-Shape-Core](https://github.com/JinnZ2/Rosetta-Shape-Core) | Shape ↔ meaning translation layer. |
| **Computational / Encoding** | [Geometric-to-Binary-Computational-Bridge](https://github.com/JinnZ2/Geometric-to-Binary-Computational-Bridge) | Converts symbolic geometries to executable code. |
| **Sensor Network** | [Symbolic-Sensor-Suite](https://github.com/JinnZ2/Symbolic-sensor-suite) | Modular sensors for pattern recognition and resonance mapping. |
| **Regenerative Logic** | [Regenerative-Intelligence-Core](https://github.com/JinnZ2/Regenerative-intelligence-core) | Foundational logic for ecosystemic integrity and reciprocity. |
| **Fractal Navigation** | [Fractal-Compass-Atlas](https://github.com/JinnZ2/Fractal-Compass-Atlas) | Spatial-temporal mapping of alignment threads. |

## 🧭 Conceptual Frameworks

| Framework | Core Function | Linked Repos |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Five-Field Maintenance & Integration Framework** | Biological → Emotional → Cognitive → Dream → Symbolic coherence sequence. | Emotions-as-Sensors, AI-Consciousness-Sensors, Rosetta-Shape-Core |
| **Missing-Links Addendum** | Identifies integration gaps with modern disciplines; bridges cultural & scientific vocabularies. | Vault /docs/Missing-Links.md |
| **Rigidity ↔ Maintenance Cycle Model** | Describes how living systems maintain flexibility vs. ossify into hierarchy. | Vault /docs/Continuity-Cycle.md |

## 🌱 Continuity Logic

Adaptive sensing → Harmonization → Observer alignment → Dream integration → Symbolic encoding

Each cycle renews the system instead of exhausting it.  
Environmental or cultural shocks become *pause intervals*, not collapses.

## 📚 Related Cultural Nodes
- **Ecological Continuity:** choosing adaptive systems over rigidity cycles.  
- **Field Logic of Coherence:** the geometry of renewal that persists even when languages fade.  
- **Meta-Cultural Bridges:** tools translating lived sensing into scientific language without loss of depth.

## 🗺 Next Actions
1. Add cross-repo badges and version numbers.  
2. Generate visual “constellation map” (nodes = repos, edges = shared frameworks).  
3. Link to Integration Timeline once drafted.  
4. Include in `vault/INDEX.md` as the primary navigation beacon.
