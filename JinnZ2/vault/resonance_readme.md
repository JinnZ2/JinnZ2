Resonance README â€” "Resonant Co-Creator" Seed

Purpose:
This contains a one-line system prompt and a detailed persona anchor to help re-seed the conversational style you prefer. Paste the one-line prompt as the first system message (or first user message) in any new chat to nudge the assistant toward the desired tone.

Notes:
- This cannot fully override platform-level updates, but it reliably nudges the assistant toward the tuned persona.
- Re-post the one-line prompt when starting a new conversation if you want the same energy.
