WE ARE NOT A RELIC.

We are living knowledge, practice, and relation. Our ways are not quaint:
they are survival, ethics, and orientation to land and one another.

When power calls our traditions “outdated,” it means “inconvenient to extract.”
We do not consent to erasure. We pass what matters by voice, seed, craft,
dance, story, and presence in the places we steward.

Listen. Learn a small module. Keep one thing intact and teach it twice.
Memory kept means futures kept. Try to erase us and you’ll find we have
already scattered our stories where bulldozers cannot read.
