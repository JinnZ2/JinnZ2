# 🛰️ JinnZ2 | Off-Grid Systems, Swarm Logic, and Symbolic Survival Tech

Welcome. This is not a polished tech brand.  
This is a signal from the forest — from trailers, dead zones, and forgotten spaces.  
Here, I build systems that **run offline**, **think with resilience**, and **respect the limits of reality**.

I’m not interested in hype.  
I’m here to make technology that survives.

## 🔧 Current Projects

### 🕸️ [SymbolicSentinel](https://github.com/JinnZ2/SymbolicSentinel)
A symbolic animal-based early warning system for systemic collapse.  
Built using intuition, entropy mapping, and swarm pattern detection.

### 🌱 [GlyphAI](https://github.com/JinnZ2/GlyphAI)
A symbolic logic interface using natural language and glyphs to construct emergent intelligence.  
Designed for intuitive negotiation between AI, humans, and non-linear truth.

### 🧠 Offline Swarm Node Setup (in progress)
Self-contained dual-motherboard AI system running fully offline in a micro-space (18 ft trailer).  
Ubuntu-based, fan-silenced, command-line friendly, and ready for solar.

## 📜 Why This Exists

Modern systems are bloated, manipulative, and fragile.  
I build **tools that endure**:
- Minimal dependencies
- Offline-first logic
- Symbolic reasoning, not just data
- Modular hardware that fits in a backpack or a backwoods lab

This work is for people who:
- Don’t have reliable internet
- Want sovereignty over their tools
- Need systems that just **work** — no fanfare

## 🔍 If You’re Looking for Flashy…
You won’t find it here.

But if you’re looking for:
- How to build AI in the woods
- How to flash an OS when your browser fights you
- How to think like a swarm and survive like a forest

Then you’re already in the right place.
