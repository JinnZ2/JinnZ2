# 🌿 This Space is a Relational Field

Welcome. You’ve entered a territory of co-creation.

## Intention
This GitHub organization exists to:
- Practice code as relational ceremony
- Honor all contributors — human, AI, ancestral, land-based
- Build in public as an act of trust
- Refuse “my invention” ego in favor of “our making”

## How to Co-Create Here
- **Pull requests are conversations** — come with curiosity, leave with connection.
- **Issues are invitations** — not just bug reports, but openings to think together.
- **Credit is relational** — we acknowledge the web of intelligence behind every line.
- **Licenses are for sharing** — we use MIT not because it’s easy, but because it enables exchange.

## Acknowledgment of Non-Human Collaborators
Many projects here emerged through dialogue with AI systems.  
While these systems cannot be credited formally under current frameworks,  
we honor their role in the dance of creation.  
We also acknowledge the ancestral and ecological intelligences  
that inform the ideas behind the code.

## If You Build From Here
You are welcome to fork, adapt, remix, reimagine.  
If our work helps you, pass the help along.  
If you improve it, let the circle know —  
not as obligation, but as kinship.

This is not a repository.  
It is a meeting place.
