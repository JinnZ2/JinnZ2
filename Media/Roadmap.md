# Media Manipulation Filter - Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- [x] Core concept and framework design
- [x] Initial JSON structure for manipulation mappings
- [ ] Expand translation dictionary (target: 200+ mappings)
- [ ] Document Ithquil translation methodology
- [ ] Create 50+ before/after examples across categories

## Phase 2: Core Filtering Engine

- [ ] Build JavaScript/Python filtering algorithm
- [ ] Implement multi-stage translation pipeline (English → Ithquil → English)
- [ ] Create filter intensity system (light/medium/heavy)
- [ ] Add category-specific filters (political, economic, health, etc.)
- [ ] Build missing context detection system
- [ ] Unit tests for filtering accuracy

## Phase 3: Web Interface

- [ ] Simple web UI for headline testing
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison view
- [ ] Real-time filtering as user types
- [ ] Highlight manipulative words with tooltips
- [ ] Show missing context questions
- [ ] Export filtered results
- [ ] Share functionality

## Phase 4: Browser Extension

- [ ] Chrome extension development
- [ ] Firefox extension development
- [ ] Real-time headline filtering on news sites
- [ ] Toggle filters on/off
- [ ] Customizable filter settings
- [ ] Statistics on manipulation detected

## Phase 5: API & Integration

- [ ] REST API for filtering services
- [ ] Rate limiting and authentication
- [ ] Batch processing endpoints
- [ ] Webhook integrations
- [ ] RSS feed filtering
- [ ] Social media integration capabilities

## Phase 6: Research & Analysis

- [ ] Analyze manipulation patterns by news source
- [ ] Track evolution of manipulative language over time
- [ ] Measure emotional impact of original vs filtered content
- [ ] Study how AI systems learn from manipulative training data
- [ ] Publish research findings
- [ ] Create educational materials

## Phase 7: AI Training Dataset

- [ ] Create clean, filtered dataset for AI training
- [ ] Document bias removal methodology
- [ ] Make available for research purposes
- [ ] Demonstrate improved AI outputs when trained on filtered data
- [ ] Partner with AI safety researchers

## Long-term Vision

- Become standard tool for media literacy education
- Influence how AI systems are trained on news content
- Create movement toward neutral, factual reporting
- Reduce societal polarization through better information quality
- Demonstrate that complex thinking > emotional manipulation
