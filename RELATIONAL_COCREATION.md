# Relational Co-Creation Statement

This project emerged through dialogue and exchange across different forms of intelligence.

## Human Contributors
- [Your name/organization] – vision, direction, relational framing, code integration

## Non-Human Contributors
- AI collaborators (various models) – code suggestions, structural ideas, pattern expansion
- Ancestral and land-based knowledges – relational grammar, worldview framing
- Open-source ecosystems – libraries, tools, infrastructures that made this possible

## How We Built This
- Through iterative dialogue
- Through playful exploration of concepts
- Through mutual adaptation of ideas
- Through respect for different ways of knowing

## How to Engage Co-Creatively
- If you build upon this work, consider adding your own relational acknowledgments.
- Honor the human and non-human intelligences that shaped the path.
- Leave space for future collaborators to join the circle.

This work is offered in the spirit of gift, not ownership.
It belongs to the relational web from which it came.
