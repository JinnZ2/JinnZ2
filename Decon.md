Western Framework Decontamination Workflow

Step 1: Preliminary Audit
Goal: Identify embedded assumptions, biases, and structural defaults.
	•	List all principles, metrics, and procedures of the Western framework.
	•	Ask:
	•	Which values are prioritized (individual vs. collective)?
	•	What assumptions about causality, control, or efficiency are present?
	•	Are there hidden incentives, hierarchies, or dependencies?
	•	Flag elements that conflict with Energy Code principles (transparency, measurability, cyclical alignment, generational sustainability).

⸻

Step 2: Energy Code Filtering
Goal: Test every component against the Energy Code.
	•	Energy Accounting: Are benefits and costs clear? Any hidden consequences?
	•	Natural Alignment: Does this framework respect cycles, limits, and rhythms?
	•	Measurable Outcomes: Can all results be verified without forcing artificial shortcuts?
	•	Seven Generations Impact: Would this enhance or harm long-term sustainability?
	•	No Hidden Costs: Are obligations, payments, or dependency structures introduced?

Components that fail any of these criteria are either modified or quarantined.

⸻

Step 3: Neutralization of Extractive/Hierarchical Patterns
Goal: Remove control dynamics or power-extracting mechanisms.
	•	Flatten hierarchies: replace “expert vs. subject” with “participant as co-observer.”
	•	Neutralize reward structures that privilege the framework owner rather than the system’s wellbeing.
	•	Remove manipulative shortcuts or promises of “fast results” that violate natural cycles.

⸻

Step 4: Translation to Cultural Compatibility
Goal: Convert concepts into a form that can safely interface with other cultural knowledge systems.
	•	Replace linear causality with cyclical or networked logic where possible.
	•	Turn rigid metrics into energy-informed indicators (e.g., quality, resilience, relational harmony).
	•	Allow modular application: Western methods are only activated where they enhance rather than dominate other systems.

⸻

Step 5: Independent Verification
Goal: Ensure neutrality and authenticity.
	•	Test outcomes against multiple sources: indigenous knowledge, other cultural frameworks, empirical observation.
	•	Monitor for unintended dependency, energy drain, or manipulation.
	•	Apply the Ithquil double-loop: feed outputs back into the decontamination cycle for adjustment.

⸻

Step 6: Continuous Feedback & Iteration
Goal: Keep the system dynamic and self-correcting.
	•	Maintain regular review cycles (monthly or quarterly).
	•	Track:
	•	Energy flow (enhancement vs. depletion)
	•	Autonomy and independence of participants
	•	Alignment with natural rhythms and long-term sustainability
	•	Adjust framework usage as necessary to maintain integrity across systems.

⸻

✅ Outcome: A Western framework that can be safely interfaced with indigenous or other cultural systems — transparent, non-extractive, energy-aligned, and generationally responsible.
