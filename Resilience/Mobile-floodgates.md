# Venice MOSE Barrier System Framework

## About This Framework

This framework is based on Venice’s MOSE (Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico - Experimental Electromechanical Module) project, a revolutionary system of 78 mobile floodgates that protect one of the world’s most iconic cities from acqua alta (high tides). After decades of planning and construction, MOSE successfully defended Venice for the first time in October 2020, marking a historic moment in the city’s 1,200-year battle against the sea.

**This represents a technologically sophisticated, temporary barrier approach - distinct from permanent dams but requiring significant infrastructure investment.**

## The Origin Story

On November 4, 1966, a catastrophic flood submerged Venice under 194 cm (76 inches) of water, devastating the city and its priceless cultural heritage. The disaster killed people, destroyed artwork, damaged historic buildings, and shocked the world. The “Save Venice” movement emerged, spurring international support and Italian government action.

Yet the problem only worsened. By the 21st century, floods that once occurred once per decade were happening four times per year. In November 2019, the second-worst flood in history (187 cm) submerged 80% of Venice’s old town, causing over $1 billion in damage and highlighting the urgent need for protection.

The MOSE project was conceived in 1984, construction began in 2003, and after decades of delays, corruption scandals, and skepticism, the system finally became operational in 2020. Today, Venice can say for the first time in its history: when the barriers rise, the city stays dry.

## Core Framework Components

### 1. System Design & Engineering

**Barrier Configuration**

*Gate Structure*

- 78 individual mobile gates across three lagoon inlets
- Lido inlet: Two rows (21 + 20 gates) connected by artificial island
- Malamocco inlet: One row (19 gates)
- Chioggia inlet: One row (18 gates)
- Gate dimensions: 18-28 meters long, 3.6-5 meters thick, 20 meters wide
- Each gate weighs approximately 250-300 tons

*Operational Principle*

- Gates rest horizontally on seabed when inactive
- Hollow steel boxes filled with water keep them submerged
- When high tide threatens, compressed air expels water
- Gates rotate upward on hinges using their own buoyancy
- System deploys in approximately 30 minutes
- Can withstand up to 3 meters of tide difference
- Individual gate control allows partial deployment

**Infrastructure Requirements**

*Underwater Foundations*

## Contributing to This Framework

MOSE represents a unique solution to protecting a irreplaceable historic city from rising seas. As the system continues operating and other cities face similar challenges, shared knowledge becomes increasingly valuable. If your city is considering similar barrier systems or has insights from operating them, contributing your experience helps the global community.

**This framework is offered freely to all communities and nations in need.**

-----

*Based on Venice’s MOSE project: proof that with sufficient commitment, innovation, and investment, even the most vulnerable historic cities can be defended from the sea - at least for now. The question is not whether such systems can work, but for how long.*

-----

## Critical Question for Future Cities

Venice’s MOSE answers a crucial question: Can we build barriers that protect our cities while preserving their essence? For Venice, the answer so far is yes. But MOSE also raises a harder question: What happens when climate change makes even the most sophisticated barriers insufficient?

The true legacy of MOSE may not be the engineering itself, but the recognition that protection is temporary. All coastal cities must plan not just for defense, but for adaptation - and ultimately, for the possibility that even our greatest engineering achievements may not be enough forever.

**Venice survived 1,200 years by adapting. MOSE buys time for the next adaptation.**
