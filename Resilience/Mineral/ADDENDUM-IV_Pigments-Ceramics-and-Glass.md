# 🏺 ADDENDUM IV — Pigments, Ceramics and Glass
_Practical transformation of natural earths into stable teaching materials._

---

## 1️⃣  Overview
Goal: demonstrate how **minerals → oxides → fired materials** create the basis of pigments, ceramics, and simple glass.  
All firing can be done in propane forges, rocket stoves, or small wood-kilns (900–1 200 °C).

---

## 2️⃣  Natural Pigment Sources

| Color | Common Source | Processing | Notes |
|:------|:----------------|:-------------|:------|
| **Red / Brown** | iron oxides (hematite, laterite, rust) | grind → wash → dry 100 °C | classic ochre pigment |
| **Yellow** | limonite, goethite | low-temp dry 250 °C | dehydrates to red at 500 °C |
| **Black** | charcoal, manganese oxide | grind fine | carbon or Mn pigment |
| **Green / Blue** | malachite, azurite, copper rust | crush → wash → dry | use tiny amounts; wear gloves |
| **White** | kaolin, chalk, gypsum | dry and calcine < 400 °C | base pigment or slip |
| **Orange / Buff** | iron-rich clay | direct firing 900 °C | terra-cotta tones |

Blend pigments with **linseed oil, egg yolk, or starch paste** for paint demos.

## 3️⃣  Clay Processing and Ceramic Forming

| Step | Action | Field Method |
|:------|:----------|:---------------|
| **Collection** | take sub-soil clay 15–30 cm deep | avoid organic topsoil |
| **Levigation** | mix with water, let sand settle | decant fine slurry |
| **Wedging** | knead to remove air | hands or foot press |
| **Forming** | coil, slab, or press mold | leather-hard stage shaping |
| **Drying** | shade 24 – 48 h | prevent cracking |
| **Bisque fire** | 800–950 °C | turns permanent ceramic |

### **Observation:**  
Color change indicates iron oxidation; shrinkage ≈ 10 – 15 %.

---

## 4️⃣  Glaze and Slip Basics

| Ingredient | Function | Approx. % |
|:-------------|:-----------|:-----------:|
| Silica (sand) | glass former | 60 – 70 |
| Ash / soda | flux | 10 – 20 |
| Clay / alumina | stabilizer | 10 – 15 |
| Oxide colorant | Fe₂O₃ / CuO / MnO₂ / CoO | < 2 |

Mix as slurry; dip bisque pieces; re-fire 1 000–1 100 °C.  
Result → glossy or satin glaze depending on ash ratio.

---

## 5️⃣  Low-Temperature Glass Demonstration

**Batch:**  
70 % clean sand  
20 % wood ash or soda ash  
10 % crushed limestone  

1. Dry-mix in crucible.  
2. Heat to ≈ 1 400 °C until viscous and bubbling stops.  
3. Pour on pre-heated metal plate → translucent bead.  
4. Optional: add 1 % copper carbonate → green glass; 1 % iron oxide → amber.  

**Concepts shown:** network formers/modifiers, silicate fusion, color by oxidation state.

## 6️⃣  Ancient Pigment Recreation (Educational)

| Name | Components | Temperature | Hue |
|:------|:-------------|:--------------:|:----|
| **Egyptian Blue** | sand + lime + copper oxide + natron | 850 – 950 °C | turquoise |
| **Red Ochre** | Fe₂O₃ natural | ambient | red-brown |
| **Yellow Ochre** | hydrated FeO(OH) | ≤ 300 °C | yellow |
| **Green Earth** | celadonite / glauconite | none | green |
| **Carbon Black** | pine soot | none | deep black |

All safe to replicate with food-grade or mineral sources.

---

## 7️⃣  Firing Atmosphere Effects

| Atmosphere | Method | Result |
|:-------------|:--------|:---------|
| **Oxidizing** | plenty of air | bright reds, browns |
| **Neutral** | sealed kiln | stable neutral colors |
| **Reducing** | limited air, add charcoal | darker greens, blues, blacks |

Teach cause-and-effect: oxygen level → oxide color state.

---

## 8️⃣  Field Safety

- Always vent kiln exhaust outdoors.  
- Keep 1 m sand bed around heat source.  
- Pre-dry all materials (> 100 °C) to prevent steam spall.  
- Handle colored oxides with gloves; avoid inhaling fine dust.  
- Reuse cooled slag as mosaic or aggregate—never discard hot.

---

## 9️⃣  Educational Extensions

| Theme | Simple Activity |
|:-------|:----------------|
| Mineral to pigment | grind local ochre → test hues on clay tile |
| Clay to ceramic | mold tribal motif → fire in pit |
| Ash to glass | melt small bead in crucible → observe clarity |
| Oxide color series | add Fe, Cu, Mn oxides in 0.5 % steps → record hue |
| Soil glaze map | different local soils fired on same tile → color atlas |
