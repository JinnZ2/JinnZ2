# ⚗️ ADDENDUM III — Simple Synthesis and Demonstrations
_Low-risk classroom and field experiments using rock-, soil-, and plant-derived reagents._

---

## 1️⃣  Overview
These demonstrations illustrate **core reaction types**—acid-base, oxidation-reduction, precipitation, and crystallization—while staying fully within non-hazardous materials available from local geology or community sources.

All setups:
- Use < 250 mL reaction volume.  
- Operate below 200 °C.  
- Require only eye protection, gloves, and outdoor or ventilated space.

## 2️⃣  Carbonate ↔ Lime ↔ Hydroxide Cycle
**Teaches:** reversible thermal decomposition, gas evolution, pH shift.

| Step | Material | Observation |
|:------|:-----------|:-------------|
| 1  Calcination | Heat crushed limestone in metal can ~700 °C for 2–3 h | CO₂ venting; white CaO residue |
| 2  Slaking | Add small amount of water | vigorous hiss → Ca(OH)₂ |
| 3  Carbonation | Bubble breath through limewater | white turbidity (CaCO₃) returns |

Equation chain:
\[
\text{CaCO₃ ⇌ CaO + CO₂ ⇌ Ca(OH)₂ ⇌ CaCO₃}
\]

## 3️⃣  Iron → Rust → Pigment Conversion
**Teaches:** oxidation, color chemistry, natural pigment production.

1. Expose cleaned steel wool to moist air + vinegar mist 24 h.  
2. Collect reddish rust; dry at 120 °C → Fe₂O₃ pigment.  
3. Mix with small linseed-oil drop → non-toxic paint base.

## 4️⃣  Crystal Growth Series

| Crystal | Reagents | Conditions | Outcome |
|:----------|:-----------|:-------------|:----------|
| **Salt (NaCl)** | table salt + warm water | cool slow evaporation | cubic crystals |
| **Alum (KAl(SO₄)₂·12H₂O)** | alum solution 40 °C | seed string | clear octahedra |
| **Copper acetate (demo only, use gloves)** | copper + vinegar + H₂O₂ (few mL) | slow evap. | blue-green plates |
| **Borax (Na₂B₄O₇·10H₂O)** | 4 tbsp borax / 1 cup hot water | hang string | translucent frost-like |

---

## 5️⃣  Natural Indicator Spectrum
**Purpose:** visualize environmental pH using color.

Prepare three jars with:  
A = acidic soil (vinegar-damped), B = neutral sand, C = ash slurry.  
Add cabbage indicator →  
A = red, B = purple, C = green/yellow.  
Show transition of soil acidity visually.

## 6️⃣  Safe Redox Demonstrations

| Reaction | Reagents | Observation | Concept |
|:------------|:-----------|:---------------|:------------|
| **Oxygen uptake** | steel wool + vinegar rinse, sealed in jar | condensation; mass ↑ | oxidation consumes O₂ |
| **Carbon oxidation** | charcoal in jar + O₂ stream | CO₂ test in limewater | combustion → gas analysis |
| **Electro-rusting** | Fe nail (+), Cu wire (–), vinegar electrolyte | iron dissolves, copper plates | redox & current flow |

---

## 7️⃣  Precipitation and Color Change Series

| Step | Mix | Result |
|:------|:------|:--------|
| A | Limewater + vinegar | white CaCO₃ cloud |
| B | Vinegar + ash solution | fizz → neutral salt |
| C | Iron-rust slurry + ash leach | dark brown solid (Fe(OH)₃) |
| D | Clay filtrate + alum solution | floc formation (coagulation demo) |

---

## 8️⃣  Carbon Cycle in a Jar
Layer: soil → plant → limewater vial.  
Seal loosely. Over days: CO₂ from decay turns limewater cloudy.  
Demonstrates biological–chemical coupling of carbon cycle.

---

## 9️⃣  Simple Battery and Electrolysis Demonstrations
**Objective:** show conversion between chemical and electrical energy.

| Setup | Electrolyte | Observation | Concept |
|:--------|:--------------|:---------------|:-----------|
| **Soil battery** | damp soil + Cu & Zn nails | small mV reading | galvanic potential |
| **Salt-water electrolysis** | NaCl(aq), graphite electrodes, 5 V | bubbles at both leads | gas evolution → electrolysis basics |

## 10️⃣  Cleanup and Re-use Cycle
- Neutralize acids with wood-ash solution, bases with vinegar.  
- Filter residues through sand/charcoal before disposal.  
- Dry and reuse rust, sand, and clay.  
- Label all containers; never mix “suspect soil” with teaching materials.
