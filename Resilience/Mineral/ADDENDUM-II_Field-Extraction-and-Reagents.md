# ⚒️ ADDENDUM II — Field Extraction and Reagents
_Low-cost preparation of teaching reagents from safe minerals and non-contact survey tests for impacted soils._

---

## 1️⃣  Purpose
Create educational-grade reagents **only from clean feedstocks** while developing non-destructive soil-screening skills for environmental observation and chemistry teaching.

---

## 2️⃣  Clean Feedstock → Useful Reagent Map

| Source Material | Simple Process | Field Product | Educational Use |
|:----------------|:----------------|:---------------|:----------------|
| **Limestone / shells** | Heat 2–3 h in vented can → quicklime → add water | Ca(OH)₂ (slaked lime) | neutralization, pH control |
| **Wood ash** | Boil in water → decant → evaporate | K₂CO₃ / Na₂CO₃ (alkali) | weak base, soap demo |
| **Salt (NaCl)** | Evaporate brine or collect from stores | NaCl | conductivity / electrolysis |
| **Clay** | Wash, settle, dry | Al-silicate base | filter media, alum source |
| **Iron rust** | Collect, dry, grind | Fe₂O₃ | pigment, oxidation catalyst |
| **Sand / quartz** | Wash, sieve | SiO₂ | glass, filtration, optics demo |
| **Vinegar + limestone** | Controlled reaction | Ca(CH₃COO)₂ solution | neutralization cycle demo |
| **Plant ash + vinegar** | React → CO₂ fizz | potassium acetate solution | mild pH buffer |

## 3️⃣  pH & Conductivity Testing of Suspect Soils
*(Observation only; no digging into chemical waste)*

| Test | Procedure | Interpretation |
|:------|:-----------|:----------------|
| **pH strip** | Mix 1 part soil + 5 parts distilled water, dip strip | < 5 = acid leach; > 9 = alkali residue |
| **Conductivity** | Insert two stainless nails 1 cm apart, measure with multimeter (Ω) | very low = clean soil; very high = salts or metal ions |
| **Magnet test** | Pass magnet near surface | metallic debris / iron oxide presence |
| **Color observation** | Compare to clean reference | rainbow sheen = hydrocarbon; vivid green/blue = copper salts; white crust = alkali |
| **Odor check (waft only)** | no contact, observe distance smell | solvent / sulfur odor = potential hydrocarbon or sulfide area |

Record readings in notebook with GPS / photo tag.  
Do **not** collect soil from suspect zones; use sterile spoon for small < 10 g samples only if necessary for pH test, then bag & seal.

## 4️⃣  Making Safe Indicators

| Indicator | Source | Extraction | Color Range |
|:------------|:---------|:-------------|:-------------|
| **Cabbage-juice pH paper** | Red cabbage leaves | Boil 10 min → filter → soak paper | red (pH < 3) → purple (7) → green/yellow (> 9) |
| **Turmeric paper** | Ground turmeric + ethanol | Dip paper → dry | yellow → brown in base |
| **Litmus analog** | Beetroot or blueberry | Boil → filter | pink (acid) → blue (base) |

These are non-toxic and can be composted after use.

## 5️⃣  Benign Reagent Preparation

| Reagent | Formula | From | Approx. Strength |
|:----------|:-----------|:----------|:----------------|
| Limewater | Ca(OH)₂(aq) | quicklime + water, decant clear layer | mild base (pH ~ 12) |
| Soda solution | Na₂CO₃(aq) | ash leach + evaporation + dissolve | weak base (pH 10–11) |
| Vinegar | CH₃COOH(aq) | fermented ethanol + air | mild acid (pH 3–4) |
| Iron oxide pigment | Fe₂O₃ | rust scraped + calcined | inert solid |
| Alum | KAl(SO₄)₂·12H₂O | clay + K₂SO₄ extraction | crystallization demo |

All safe for classroom-level demonstrations when handled with gloves and eyewear.

## 6️⃣  Non-contact Soil Screening Workflow

1. **Visual survey** → note color patches, residue, plant die-off.  
2. **Magnet + pH + conductivity** → quick triage.  
3. **Record coordinates** → GPS + notebook + photo.  
4. **Sample only if readings differ by > 2 pH units or > 5× conductivity** from background.  
5. **Seal samples** → HDPE bags; label with date, depth (0–5 cm).  
6. Store outdoors until professional lab can verify metals or hydrocarbons.

## 7️⃣  Demonstration Chemistry from Clean Materials

| Demo | Reaction | Teaching Outcome |
|:-------|:-----------|:----------------|
| **Lime cycle** | CaCO₃ ↔ CaO ↔ Ca(OH)₂ ↔ CaCO₃ | shows chemical reversibility |
| **Rust pigment** | 4 Fe + 3 O₂ → 2 Fe₂O₃ | oxidation process |
| **Soap from ash + oil** | KOH + fat → soap + glycerol | acid-base neutralization |
| **Vinegar neutralization** | CH₃COOH + Ca(OH)₂ → Ca(CH₃COO)₂ + H₂O | salt formation |
| **pH indicator test** | cabbage paper in various soils | visible chemistry of environment |

All are safe for outdoor teaching and avoid any direct contact with dump residues.
