# üåç ADDENDUM V ‚Äî Safety and Environmental Handling
_Practices for protecting people, air, water, and soil while operating community or teaching labs._

## 1Ô∏è‚É£  Core Principles
1. **Observe first, disturb last.**  If you can learn from sight, color, or pH, do that before digging or burning.  
2. **Air ‚Üî Water ‚Üî Soil ‚Üî Life** ‚Äî every experiment connects to these four. Close the loop.  
3. **Substitute > Contain > Neutralize > Return.** Prefer nontoxic materials, capture waste, neutralize, then return clean matter to earth.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£  Personal and Site Safety

| Operation | Minimum PPE | Location | Key Rule |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------|:-----------|
| Grinding, mixing powders | mask (N95 or cloth + wetting) + goggles | outdoors / ventilated shed | keep materials damp |
| Firing or melting | leather gloves, face shield | open-air kiln area | never seal flue completely |
| Acid / base work (vinegar + ash, lime) | nitrile gloves, goggles | table with catch tray | keep rinse water nearby |
| Soil sampling | gloves + mask | wind-down direction of site | do not eat or smoke nearby |
| General cleanup | gloves + bucket of neutral water | all zones | label all rinse buckets |

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£  Ventilation and Fire Safety

- Place all hot work ‚â• 3 m from walls or vegetation.  
- Build a **chimney stack** or simple vent pipe to direct fumes upward.  
- Keep a **metal lid** or sand bucket for smothering flare-ups.  
- Use **no plastics** inside fire zones‚Äîrelease of chlorine / dioxins is dangerous.  
- When indoors: minimum 6 air changes / hour via open window + fan.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£  Waste ‚Üí Resource Loop

| Waste Type | Treatment | Re-use |
|:------------|:------------|:------------|
| Ash from wood or kiln | sieve ‚Üí store dry | flux, fertilizer (K & Ca) |
| Spent clay / glaze slurry | let settle ‚Üí dry cake | road fill, sandbag core |
| Wash water (mild pH 6-9) | filter through sand + charcoal | reuse for mixing |
| Rust and oxides | dry & store | pigment or iron additive |
| Broken ceramic | crush | aggregate for new clay body |

> Nothing leaves the lab un-named. Label each bucket until you know where it belongs.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£  Neutralization Guide

| Substance | Symptom | Neutralizer | End pH Target |
|:------------|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------:|
| Vinegar / acid | pH < 5 | add wood-ash solution | 7 ¬± 1 |
| Ash / lime solution | pH > 9 | add diluted vinegar | 7 ¬± 1 |
| Mixed sludge | both present | alternate additions while stirring | 7 ¬± 1 |
| Colored rinse (oxide) | visible pigment | filter ‚Üí dry residue ‚Üí reuse | ‚Äî |

## 6Ô∏è‚É£  Water and Soil Protection

1. Set up **sand + charcoal filter barrel** for all rinse water.  
2. Collect gray water in sealed bucket until neutralized.  
3. Never dump within 30 m of wells, lakes, or streams.  
4. After firing, **cover ash pits** to prevent leaching during rain.  
5. Plant **grasses or legumes** around lab site‚Äîroot uptake binds stray metals.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£  Storage and Labeling

| Material | Container | Shelf Life | Label Example |
|:-----------|:-------------|:--------------:|:----------------|
| Vinegar / acids | glass or HDPE bottle | 1 yr | ‚ÄúVinegar pH 3 ‚Äì Mild Acid ‚Äì 2025-04‚Äù |
| Lime / ash | airtight jar | 6 mo | ‚ÄúAsh Leach pH 10 ‚Äì Weak Base ‚Äì 2025-04‚Äù |
| Pigments / oxides | glass or tin w/ desiccant | indef. | ‚ÄúIron Oxide Pigment ‚Äì Source #3‚Äù |
| Oils / resins | amber glass in shade | 12 mo | ‚ÄúLinseed Oil ‚Äì For Binder‚Äù |
| Clay / glaze mix | sealed plastic tub | 3 mo | ‚ÄúLocal Clay Batch #4‚Äù |

Always record **date + source + hazard symbol**.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£  Emergency Actions (Minimal-equipment)

| Incident | First Action | Follow-Up |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------|
| **Skin contact (acid/base)** | Rinse ‚â• 15 min with clean water | Apply neutral pH balm |
| **Inhalation of smoke/fume** | Move to fresh air | Rest > 30 min; seek help if dizzy |
| **Fire / flare-up** | Cut heat ‚Üí smother with sand / lid | Check site 1 h later for reignition |
| **Spill to soil** | Scoop damp sand over area ‚Üí collect | Dry, test pH, store for later neutralization |
| **Broken glass / crucible** | Sweep into metal can | Recycle with ceramics |

Keep an emergency contact list and local Tribal or county response number on wall.

## 9Ô∏è‚É£  Environmental Monitoring Log (Community Form)


Date:
Location / GPS:
Material handled:
Weather / wind:
pH of rinse water:
Any smoke or spill?  [ ]
Containment used:
Follow-up required:
Signed by:


Weekly logging builds traceability for any future grant or remediation effort.

## üîü  Long-Term Stewardship

- Replant **native vegetation** around lab footprint yearly.  
- Store digital & paper copies of all environmental logs.  
- Teach next generation safety through participation, not fear.  
- When materials accumulate beyond reuse, partner with regional universities for sample testing; many will assist free for educational projects.

**Appendix (optional):** pH color chart, neutralization flow diagram, and simplified site plan template for community record-keeping.
