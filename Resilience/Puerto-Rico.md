# Puerto Rico Community Storm Resilience Framework

## About This Framework

This framework is based on Puerto Rico’s grassroots response to Hurricane Maria (2017) and Hurricane Fiona (2022), when the government abandoned communities and residents created their own solutions. When the centralized power grid failed for up to 11 months, leaving 4,000+ people dead from lack of medical care and basic services, communities built their own solar microgrids, mutual aid networks, and distributed resilience systems.

**Key insight: Don’t wait for help that won’t come. Build community resilience with what you have, where you are, starting now.**

This framework is for working-class and poor communities who know they’ll be abandoned during disasters - and refuse to accept that fate.

## The Origin Story

Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017 as one of the most devastating storms in U.S. history. The entire island lost power. The federal response was criminally inadequate. The centralized electrical grid, based on fossil fuels and controlled by a corrupt utility (PREPA), created conditions for catastrophic failure.

**The aftermath was worse than the storm:**

- 4,000+ people died from lack of electricity (no medical equipment, refrigeration, clean water)
- Some rural communities without power for 11 months
- Federal aid tied up in red tape for years
- Poor and rural communities abandoned first, helped last
- Young people fled the island permanently

**But communities fought back:**

- Casa Pueblo in Adjuntas became a model of solar independence
- Neighbors pooled resources to build community microgrids
- Mutual aid networks provided what government couldn’t
- Local organizations like Proyecto de Apoyo Mutuo (Project for Mutual Aid) emerged
- “Autogestión” (self-management) became a survival strategy

**The result:** Puerto Rico’s grassroots energy democracy movement proves that abandoned communities can create their own resilience - without permission, without waiting, without depending on institutions that will fail them.

## Core Framework Components

### 1. Community-Owned Solar Microgrids

**What Are Microgrids?**

*Basic Concept:*

- Small electrical systems that can disconnect from main grid
- Generate and store their own power
- Keep running when everything else fails
- Serve 5-50 buildings typically
- Community-owned, not utility-controlled

*Why They Work for Poor Communities:*

- Shared cost (neighbors pool resources)
- Local control (no waiting for utility company)
- Storm-resistant (distributed, not centralized)
- Cheaper long-term (no monthly electric bills)
- Can be built incrementally (start small, expand)

**The Adjuntas Model**

*Casa Pueblo’s Pioneer System:*

- Started with solar panels in 1999
- Expanded after Maria to power 14 local businesses
- Pharmacy, hardware store, bakery, barbershop
- Community celebration when system completed (parade with flags!)
- “We want to democratize the generation of energy”
- Goal: “Help decolonize Puerto Rico”

*How It Works:*

- 700 rooftop solar panels across multiple buildings
- Battery storage for 10+ days of power
- Can run completely independent of main grid
- Excess power sold back to reduce community bills
- Locally owned and operated
- Provides essential services during outages

*Community Benefits:*

- Refrigeration for medicine (insulin, etc.)
- Cell phone charging stations
- Emergency lighting and communications
- Business continuity during disasters
- Community gathering space with power
- Economic development (businesses stay open)

**The Castañer Mountain Model**

*Cooperativa Hidroeléctrica de la Montaña:*

- First rural electric cooperative on the island
- Serves 90,000 people across 4 municipalities
- Two microgrids plus individual systems
- 41 kW solar + 74 kWh battery storage (first phase)
- 74 kW solar + 92.5 kWh battery (second phase)

*Proven Storm Performance:*

- Operated before, during, and after Hurricane Fiona
- Only system working in region
- Served 5 businesses and 2 homes continuously
- “Served as inspiration for the community that better days are coming”
- Businesses provided essential services during recovery

### 2. Distributed vs. Centralized Power

**Why Centralized Systems Fail**

*Puerto Rico’s Grid Problems:*

- Single points of failure
- Corruption in utility management
- Expensive fossil fuel dependence
- Vulnerable transmission lines
- No local control or ownership
- Serves wealthy areas first

*Climate Reality:*

- Storms getting stronger and more frequent
- Infrastructure can’t be rebuilt fast enough
- Government response inadequate
- Insurance companies abandoning storm zones
- Migration and population loss

**Distributed Resilience Strategy**

*Multiple Small Systems vs. One Big System:*

- If one microgrid fails, others keep working
- Can be repaired locally with local labor
- Community members trained to maintain
- Expansion happens organically
- No single point of catastrophic failure

*Networking Microgrids:*

- Multiple microgrids can share power
- “Microgrid orchestrator” technology
- If one system damaged, others compensate
- Resilience multiplied through cooperation
- Research happening at Oak Ridge National Laboratory

### 3. Mutual Aid and Community Organization

**Proyecto de Apoyo Mutuo Model**

*Founded in Response to Maria:*

- Grassroots organization for community support
- Partners with mainland groups (Mutual Aid Disaster Relief)
- Installs solar systems at community centers
- Art therapy spaces, kitchens, laundries, libraries
- Community-controlled, not charity

*What Mutual Aid Provides:*

- Emergency food and water distribution
- Medical equipment operation
- Communication networks
- Emotional and psychological support
- Skills sharing and education
- Political organizing for community needs

**Community Center Strategy**

*Multi-Purpose Community Spaces:*

- Community centers as resilience hubs
- Solar-powered refrigeration
- Communication equipment
- Emergency medical equipment
- Meeting and organizing space
- Cultural and educational programs

*Examples Working:*

- Mariana neighborhood, Humacao: 16kW system powers art therapy, kitchen, laundry, library
- Caguas: 4kW system powers refrigerators
- Multiple community centers across eastern PR
- Locally controlled and managed

### 4. Economic Democracy and Autogestión

**Community Ownership Models**

*Why Ownership Matters:*

- Decisions made by community, not corporation
- Profits stay in community
- System designed for community needs
- Local control over maintenance and expansion
- Builds community wealth, not outside wealth

*Cooperative Structures:*

- Hydroelectric Cooperative of the Mountain (first rural electric coop)
- Community-owned microgrids
- Shared ownership of solar installations
- Democratic decision-making processes
- Transparent financial management

**Autogestión (Self-Management)**

*Principle:*

- Communities manage their own resources
- Don’t wait for permission or outside help
- Build capacity for self-reliance
- Political organizing combined with practical solutions
- “Pushing from the bottom up”

*In Practice:*

- Communities install their own solar systems
- Local training for maintenance and repair
- Community meetings to make decisions
- Resource sharing and skill sharing
- Resistance to outside control

### 5. Storm-Resistant Design

**Lessons from Hurricane Fiona**

*What Worked:*

- Microgrids designed for Category 5 winds
- Battery storage raised on concrete pads
- Marine-environment rated equipment
- Ground-mounted solar (not roof-mounted in some cases)
- Reinforced racking secured deep in ground
-
