COMMUNITY COPPER RECOVERY
What Small Communities Can Do RIGHT NOW

THE REALITY

Copper is already constrained. You can't wait for 'someone' to solve it. But communities CAN recover and recycle copper locally - and should start NOW.

TIER 1: START THIS WEEK (No Special Equipment)

1. Community E-Waste Collection
What to collect:
● Old computers, monitors, printers (motherboards have copper traces)
● Power supplies (copper windings in transformers)
● Old TVs, stereos, appliances (copper in motors, transformers)
● Extension cords, power cables (pure copper wire)
● Old electric motors from tools, appliances (copper windings)
● Old transformers, ballasts from lighting (heavy copper content)
How to organize:
● Set up monthly collection day (community center, church, school parking lot)
● Create simple sorting: Wire/cable, Motors, Circuit boards, Everything else
● Partner with local scrap yard initially (they'll pay for sorted copper)
● Track what you collect (weight, types) - you're building data
Reality check: A typical community of 5,000 people generates 10-50 tons of e-waste annually. That's 500-2,000 lbs of recoverable copper just sitting in garages and closets.

2. Building Demolition Salvage
Before buildings get demolished:
● Contact property owners/demolition companies about salvage rights
● Pull copper wire from walls BEFORE demo (romex, solid copper wire)
● Remove copper plumbing (pipes, fittings)
● Salvage HVAC units (copper coils, refrigerant lines)
● Take water heaters (copper heat exchangers in some models)
Single house demo: 100-400 lbs copper wire + 50-200 lbs copper plumbing = 150-600 lbs total

3. Build Community Knowledge Base
Document who knows what:
● Electricians (wire stripping, safe handling)
● Plumbers (identifying copper vs brass vs other metals)
● HVAC techs (recovering refrigerant safely, extracting copper coils)
● Mechanics (pulling copper from old radiators, starters, alternators)
● Anyone who's worked in recycling/scrap
Schedule skill-sharing sessions monthly. Knowledge compounds.

TIER 2: BUILD IN FIRST 3 MONTHS (Modest Equipment)

1. Community Wire Stripping Station
Equipment needed (total cost: $500-2,000):
● Manual wire strippers ($50-200) - remove insulation from wire
● Wire cutters, pliers, basic hand tools ($100)
● Sorting bins (separate by wire gauge/type)
● Scale for weighing ($50-200)
● Work tables, ventilation if indoors
Process:
● Volunteers work a few hours weekly stripping wire
● Bare copper wire gets MUCH better scrap prices (3-5x more than insulated)
● Creates community meeting space (people work together, build relationships)
● Revenue from scrap sales funds more equipment
Output: 5 volunteers × 3 hours/week can process 100-300 lbs wire/month

2. Electric Motor Teardown
Why motors matter:
● Every washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, power tool has copper-wound motors
● Motor windings are high-purity copper (magnet wire)
● Most people throw motors away as 'scrap steel' - copper inside is valuable
Basic process:
● Disassemble motor casings (steel housing, bearings separate)
● Extract stator/rotor (where copper windings are)
● Burn off enamel coating (outdoor, ventilated - or skip and sell as 'motor copper')
● Recover bare copper wire
Single washing machine motor: 5-15 lbs copper. Dryer motor: 3-8 lbs copper.

3. Partner With Local Businesses
Approach electricians, HVAC companies, plumbers:
● They generate copper scrap constantly (old wire, pipe, fixtures)
● Often too busy to sort/process it properly
● Offer to pick up their scrap, process it, split proceeds
● They get revenue without extra work, you get steady supply
Single HVAC company generates 500-2,000 lbs copper annually from service calls

TIER 3: BUILD IN 6-12 MONTHS (Serious Infrastructure)

1. Community Microfoundry
Purpose: Actually REFINE recovered copper into usable forms
Equipment needed ($5,000-15,000):
● Propane or induction furnace (melt copper at 1,984°F)
● Crucibles (hold molten copper)
● Molds (cast copper into ingots, wire, specific shapes)
● Safety equipment (heat shields, protective gear, ventilation)
● Basic testing equipment (verify copper purity)
What this enables:
● Convert scrap copper into USABLE copper (wire, bus bars, fittings)
● Create local supply independent of global chains
● Support local electricians, repair shops with copper materials
● Build community capability for actual metal refining
IMPORTANT: Start with small test batches. Learn the process. Safety is critical when working with molten metal.

2. Circuit Board Processing
Reality:
● Circuit boards contain copper, gold, silver, palladium
● Most valuable e-waste stream per pound
● Also most complex to process safely
Options:
● Initial: Collect and sell to specialized recyclers (they have proper chemical processing)
● Advanced: Learn safe chemical extraction methods (requires proper equipment, ventilation, waste handling)
DON'T try to process circuit boards without proper equipment and knowledge. Toxic fumes, acid handling risks are real.

WHAT THIS ACTUALLY BUILDS

Beyond just recovering copper:

● Community resilience: Local copper supply when global chains fail
● Skill development: Metalworking, salvage, refining knowledge spreads
● Cooperation networks: People working together builds trust and capability
● Economic benefit: Revenue stays in community instead of going to distant scrap yards
● Material awareness: People understand physical constraints when they handle actual atoms
● Foundation for more: Copper recovery → aluminum → steel → complete material recovery
REALISTIC COMMUNITY TIMELINE

● Month 1-2: Start e-waste collection, identify skilled community members, organize first sorting events
● Month 3-4: Set up wire stripping station, establish partnerships with local trades, regular weekly collection
● Month 5-8: Add motor teardown, refine processes, track data, build revenue stream
● Month 9-12: Consider microfoundry if community is committed, serious training required
● Year 2+: Expand to aluminum, steel, rare earth recovery. Build complete material recovery capability
THE BOTTOM LINE

You don't need permission. You don't need big budgets. You need:

● A few people willing to organize collection
● Space to work (garage, shed, community center)
● Basic hand tools to start
● Willingness to learn and share knowledge
Start small. Build capability. The atoms are already in your community - in old electronics, demolished buildings, broken appliances.

Nobody's coming to save you. But you can save yourselves by working together.

The copper exists. Go get it.
