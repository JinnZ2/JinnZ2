# Landslide Prevention and Adaptation Framework

## About This Framework

This framework is based primarily on Japan’s comprehensive landslide management systems, developed over centuries in response to Japan’s mountainous terrain, heavy rainfall, and frequent seismic activity. Japan experiences an average of 1,500 landslides per year - a 50% increase from a decade ago due to climate change. Through traditional terracing methods, modern engineering, reforestation programs called “chisan” (fix the mountain), AI-powered early warning systems, and community-based approaches, Japan has become the world leader in landslide risk management.

**This addresses adaptation to increasing extreme rainfall, slope instability, and landslide risk - a growing threat as climate change intensifies storms globally.**

-----

## The Origin Story

Japan’s geography makes it exceptionally vulnerable: 75% of the nation is mountainous, and 75% of assets are in flood-prone areas. Following severe forest overharvesting during World War II and subsequent reconstruction, mountain disasters became catastrophic. The Forestry Agency responded by developing “chisan” - comprehensive mountain stabilization combining reforestation, thinning for root growth, protection forests, erosion-control dams, terracing, and drainage wells.

Recent climate-driven disasters have killed dozens and destroyed hundreds of homes. In 2018, torrential rains caused mudslides killing over 114 people. In 2021, the Atami landslide affected 300 homes. Japan’s government identified over 1,200 high-risk sites requiring immediate intervention nationwide, with 92% of municipalities (1,606 out of 1,742) marked as Sediment Disaster Prone Areas.

Marc Forni, World Bank’s Lead Disaster Risk Management Specialist, states: “Without question, Japan is the best in this area of expertise.” Their integrated approach combining traditional knowledge, modern engineering, vegetation management, and community engagement offers a model for landslide-prone regions worldwide.

## Core Framework Components

### 1. Understanding Landslides

**What Causes Landslides?**

*Primary Triggers:*

- Heavy rainfall saturating soil
- Rising water tables reducing friction
- Earthquakes destabilizing slopes
- Deforestation removing root systems
- Human activities (construction, mining, poor drainage)
- Snowmelt adding water weight
- Soil erosion from poor land management

*Climate Change Amplification:*

- More intense rainfall events
- Longer duration storms
- Changing precipitation patterns
- Increased frequency of extreme weather
- Soil saturation from multiple events
- Permafrost melting in cold regions

**Types of Landslides:**

*Surface Slides:*

- Top layer of soil slides over bedrock
- Typically within reach of tree roots
- Can be prevented with vegetation
- Often triggered by saturation

*Deep-Seated/Bedrock Landslides:*

- Occurs in bedrock beneath root systems
- Beyond vegetation’s protective capacity
- Requires engineering solutions
- More destructive and harder to prevent
- Increasingly common with intense rainfall

**Warning Signs:**

- Cracks in ground, walls, or pavement
- Leaning trees, poles, or fences
- Doors/windows sticking suddenly
- New springs or seeps on slopes
- Ground surface rippling or bulging
- Sudden drainage changes
- Sounds like trees cracking or boulders knocking

### 2. Vegetative Solutions

**The Role of Plants**

*How Vegetation Prevents Landslides:*

- Roots bind soil together mechanically
- Reduces surface water runoff
- Improves water infiltration
- Slows raindrops before impact
- Removes water through transpiration

*Most Effective Species (context-dependent):*

- Deep-rooted broadleaf trees (Japanese theory)
- Native grasses with extensive root systems
- Shrubs like Lespedeza (Japan uses extensively)
- Bamboo for rapid stabilization
- Mixed species better than monoculture
- Local native species adapted to conditions

**Japanese Chisan Method**

*“Fix the Mountain” Approach:*

- Strategic reforestation of vulnerable slopes
