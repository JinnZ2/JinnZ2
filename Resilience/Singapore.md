# Singapore Integrated Water Management Framework

## About This Framework

This framework is based on Singapore’s comprehensive “Four National Taps” strategy - an integrated approach to water security that combines local catchment, imported water, advanced recycled water (NEWater), and desalination. Singapore transformed from facing polluted rivers, water shortages, and flooding in the 1960s-70s to achieving water self-sufficiency through integrated management. The Marina Barrage exemplifies this approach: a single infrastructure serving water supply, flood control, and urban recreation simultaneously.

**This represents a holistic, technology-intensive, multi-purpose approach requiring strong government capacity and long-term vision.**

## The Origin Story

At independence in 1965, Singapore was one of the world’s most water-vulnerable nations. As a small island lacking natural water resources like large rivers, natural springs or glaciers, with limited land to collect and store rainwater, Singapore is among the most water-stressed countries globally. The nation depended almost entirely on water imported from Malaysia - a precarious situation given political tensions.

In the 1970s, severe flooding killed seven people and devastated the city. Rivers were polluted, water was scarce, and the nation’s survival seemed uncertain. Then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew declared that “every other policy has to bend at the knees for our water survival.”

Singapore responded with what became a 50-year transformation: cleaning polluted rivers (1977-1987), creating reservoirs, developing NEWater recycling technology, building desalination plants, and constructing the Marina Barrage. By 2011, Singapore achieved water self-sufficiency decades ahead of the 2061 target, turning existential vulnerability into world-leading innovation.

## The Singapore Model’s Global Impact

Singapore has become a global knowledge hub for urban water management. Through Singapore International Water Week and other forums, the nation shares expertise with cities worldwide. The success demonstrates that even the most water-vulnerable places can achieve security through innovation, planning, and commitment.

**Core Message:**
Water scarcity is not destiny. With integrated planning, advanced technology, public support, and sustained commitment, cities can transform vulnerability into resilience. Singapore’s journey from extreme water insecurity to abundance in just 50 years proves that determined nations can engineer their way out of resource constraints.

**This framework is offered freely to all communities and nations seeking water security.**
