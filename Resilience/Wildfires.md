# Wildfire Adaptation and Cultural Fire Management Framework

## About This Framework

This framework combines Indigenous cultural burning practices (used for 60,000+ years by Aboriginal Australians and by Indigenous peoples globally) with modern community-based wildfire adaptation strategies. While other frameworks address water and heat, this addresses FIRE - one of the most immediate climate threats facing communities in California, Australia, Portugal, Canada, Greece, and beyond.

**The core insight: Fight fire WITH fire - but done right, at the right time, in the right way.**

## The Origin Story

### Aboriginal Australia: 60,000 Years of Fire Management

Aboriginal Australians have used fire to manage land since time immemorial. Small, controlled “cool burns” in the early dry season create a mosaic of burnt and unburnt patches - providing habitat variety, reducing fuel loads, and preventing catastrophic wildfires. Australia’s flora and fauna evolved TO LIVE WITH FIRE and many species now require these burns to survive.

When Europeans colonized Australia in 1788, they viewed fire as destructive and suppressed Indigenous burning practices. Without regular cool burns, dry grasses built up, providing fuel for lightning-sparked mega-fires. The 2019-20 Australian bushfires consumed 18.6 million hectares and killed 1.25 billion animals - a direct result of abandoning traditional fire management.

Today, 32 Indigenous-operated savanna fire projects manage 22 million hectares in northern Australia, reducing emissions by 1 million tonnes per year while protecting biodiversity and strengthening Indigenous culture.

### Portugal: Learning From Tragedy

Portugal burns an average of 1% of its land annually - more than double any other EU country. In 2017, wildfires killed 64 people in Pedrógão Grande, with many burning to death in their cars trying to escape. The disaster traced back to rural abandonment, eucalyptus monocultures planted during authoritarian rule, and suppression of traditional fire use.

Portugal pivoted from firefighting to fire prevention, establishing the integrated fire agency (AGIF) and embracing community-led approaches including prescribed burns, fuel reduction, and landscape management.

**Both examples prove: You can’t suppress fire. You must work WITH it.**

## Core Framework Components

### 1. Understanding Cultural Burning

**What Is Cultural/Cool Burning?**

*Indigenous Practice:*

- Small, frequent, cool fires during cooler months/seasons
- Burns slowly through undergrowth, not canopy
- Creates patchy mosaic of burnt and unburnt areas
- Timed according to natural indicators (flowering, grass curing)
- Burns “for country” not for statistics
- Spiritual and cultural practice, not just technique

*How It Differs From Hazard Reduction:*

- Cool burns: 1-2m high flames, ~200-300°C
- Hazard reduction: 10-30m flames, ~600-1000°C
- Cool burns: Preserves tree canopy and soil nutrients
- Hazard reduction: Often kills canopy and bakes soil
- Cool burns: Frequent, small-scale, landscape-specific
- Hazard reduction: Infrequent, large-scale, standardized

**Benefits:**

- Reduces catastrophic wildfire risk by 70-90%
- Increases biodiversity (patchy habitat mosaic)
- Protects carbon storage in tree canopy
- Stimulates seed germination
- Provides habitat for native animals
- Reduces greenhouse gas emissions vs. mega-fires
- Cultural and spiritual healing
- Intergenerational knowledge transfer

### 2. Timing and Technique

**When to Burn**

*Seasonal Timing (varies by region):*

- Australia: Early dry season (March-July)
- California: Late fall to early spring
- Mediterranean: Winter and early spring
- Follow Indigenous seasonal calendars
- Observe natural indicators specific to your region

*Daily Timing:*

- Night or early morning ideal
- Nightly dew cools fire
- Gentle winds
- Lower temperatures
- Higher humidity

**How to Burn Safely**

*Traditional Method:*

- Walk the land on foot
- Light small fires with matches or traditional firesticks
- Burn in strategic patterns
- Create mosaic, not complete coverage
- Monitor constantly
- Burn toward natural or created firebreaks

*Scale:*

- Small patches (few hectares at a time)
- Frequent burns (every 2-3 years per area)
- Different areas on different schedules
- Creates diversity across landscape

**What to Burn:**

- Undergrowth and ground fuels
- Dry grass and leaf litter
- Small shrubs and bracken
- Leave tree canopy intact
- Protect culturally significant areas
- Respect water sources and sensitive sites

### 3. Community-Based Fire Adaptation

**Community Preparation (Portugal Model)**

*Before Fire Season:*

- Clear scrub around villages (100m+ buffer zones)
- Remove eucalyptus near homes if possible
- Create firebreaks on ridges and strategic locations
- Develop evacuation plans
- Establish communication networks
- Designate safe zones and rally points

*Village-Level Organization:*

- Form fire committees
- Train community fire brigades
- Purchase shared equipment (pumps, hoses)
- Create water reserves
- Practice evacuation drills
- Connect with neighboring communities

*Individual Property:*

- Clear 30-50 meters “defensible space” around homes
- Remove dead vegetation and leaf litter
- Trim tree branches away from structures
- Non-combustible roofing and walls if possible
- Water storage and pump systems
- Ember-resistant vents and screens

### 4. Landscape Management

**Fuel Reduction**

*Strategic Approach:*

- Network of primary and secondary firebreaks
- Prescribed burns in targeted areas
- Grazing (sheep, goats, cattle) reduces fuel
- Mechanical clearing where appropriate
- Maintain mosaic of vegetation types

*What Portugal Learned:*

- Firebreaks alone won’t stop fire
- Must integrate with broader prevention
- Area-wide landscape treatment essential
- Fuel breaks provide anchor for prescribed fire
- Continuous, not just before fire season

**Land Use Integration**

*Agricultural Systems:*

- Mixed agroforestry (not monocultures)
- Pastoral grazing maintains lower fuel loads
- Diverse crops create natural firebreaks
- Traditional farming practices matter
- Discourage abandonment of rural land

*Forest Management:*

- Avoid eucalyptus monocultures (highly flammable)
- Native species more fire-resistant
- Diverse age classes of trees
- Maintain open understory through burning or grazing
- Thin overly dense forests

### 5. Fire-Adapted Architecture

**Building for Fire**

*Home Hardening:*

- Metal or tile roofing (not wood shake)
- Stucco, brick, or concrete walls
- Tempered glass or metal shutters
- Metal mesh screens on vents
- Non-combustible decking
- Underground utilities where possible

*Underground Option:*

- Underground homes essentially fireproof (see Coober Pedy framework)
- Ventilation shafts need ember protection
- Safe refuge during fire
- No combustible exterior
- Can be combined with surface farming/ranching

*Traditional Adaptations:*

- Stone or earth construction
- Minimal wood use

## Closing Thoughts

Wildfires are getting worse, but we know how to live with fire. Indigenous peoples managed fire successfully for tens of thousands of years. The solution isn’t more suppression - it’s working WITH fire through cultural burning, community preparation, and landscape management.

You can start today:

- Clear defensible space around your home
- Connect with Indigenous fire practitioners
- Join or form a community fire committee
- Learn about prescribed burning
- Support Indigenous-led fire programs
- Advocate for better policies

**Fire is coming. The question is whether it comes as a catastrophic mega-fire or as many small cool burns that protect rather than destroy.**

This isn’t just about survival - it’s about cultural revival, biodiversity protection, carbon reduction, and community resilience. Fire, done right, heals the land.

**This framework is offered in solidarity with Indigenous peoples who’ve always known how to live with fire, and with all communities facing wildfire threats. The knowledge exists. We must listen, learn, and act.**
