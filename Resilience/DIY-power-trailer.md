# DIY Portable Microgrid Trailer Guide

## About This Guide

This is a practical guide for building a portable, off-grid power system on a trailer that can serve scattered rural households, emergency situations, or communities with unreliable utility service. This is NOT a product you buy - it’s something you BUILD with available materials and skills, adapted to your specific needs and resources.

**Key Concept: Mobile energy independence that goes where it’s needed.**

**Flexible Applications:**

- Serve 3-5 households in rotation
- Emergency medical equipment operation
- Community events and gatherings
- Disaster response and recovery
- Traditional ceremonies requiring power
- Construction sites and remote work
- Temporary power while building permanent systems

**Advantages Over Fixed Systems:**

- One system serves multiple locations
- Can evacuate with community if needed
- Adaptable to changing needs
- Lower total cost than multiple fixed installations
- Community can test and learn before committing to permanent systems
- Completely independent of utility infrastructure

-----

## Basic System Components

- Charge controller(s) for each power source

**Energy Storage:**

- Battery bank (lithium or lead-acid)
- Battery management system
- Temperature monitoring

**Power Distribution:**

- Inverter (DC to AC conversion)
- Circuit breakers and fuses
- Outlets (120V AC and/or 12V DC)
- Monitoring system

**Trailer Platform:**

## Design Considerations

### Size and Capacity Planning

**Start Small, Scale Up:**

- Begin with what you can afford and build
- Test with actual loads before expanding
- Add capacity as you learn what’s needed
- Modular design allows easy upgrades

**Power Needs Assessment:**

- What will you actually power? (lights, fridge, medical equipment, tools)
- How many watts per device?
- How many hours per day?
- Surge power requirements (starting motors, etc.)
- Safety margin (don’t run at 100% capacity)

**Example Size Ranges:**

*Small System (1-2 households):*

- 400-800W solar
- 200-400Ah battery storage
- 1000-2000W inverter
- Can fit on small 4x6 trailer

*Medium System (3-5 households):*

- 1000-2000W solar
- 400-800Ah battery storage
- 2000-3000W inverter
- Requires 5x8 or 6x10 trailer

*Large System (community hub):*

- 2000W+ solar
- 800Ah+ battery storage
- 3000W+ inverter
- 6x12 or larger trailer

### Mobility vs. Capacity Trade-offs

**More Power = Heavier = Less Mobile:**

- Decide if you need to move it often
- Consider trailer size your vehicle can tow
- Balance weight with power needs
- Plan for weather (wind load with panels up)

**Deployment Strategies:**

- Park semi-permanently, move when needed
- Rotate between locations on schedule
- Emergency deployment only
- Seasonal relocation

## Component Selection Guide

### Solar Panels

**Types:**

- **Rigid panels:** More efficient, durable, cheaper per watt
- **Flexible panels:** Lighter, can conform to curved surfaces, more expensive
- **Portable folding panels:** Easy to deploy/pack, moderate efficiency

**Mounting Options:**

- Fixed flat mount on trailer roof
- Tilting mounts for optimal angle
- Deployable ground mounts (more panels, better angle)
- Combination approach

**Considerations:**

- Wind resistance when traveling or deployed
- Theft/vandalism protection
- Easy to clean and maintain
- Secure mounting (storms, bumpy roads)

### Wind Turbines

**Why Add Wind:**

- Power generation at night
- Works in cloudy weather
- Complements solar (wind often when sun isn’t)
- Faster charging in good wind

**Types:**

- Vertical axis (better for variable wind direction)
- Horizontal axis (more efficient in steady wind)
- Small turbines (400-1000W typical for trailer systems)

**Mounting:**

- Folding mast that raises/lowers
- Guy wires for stability
- Must be secured for travel
- Consider height restrictions when moving

### Battery Storage

**Battery Types:**

*Lithium (LiFePO4):*

- Pros: Lighter, longer lifespan, deeper discharge, faster charging
- Cons: More expensive upfront
- Best for: Mobile systems where weight matters

*Lead-Acid (AGM or Gel):*

- Pros: Cheaper, proven technology, widely available
- Cons: Heavier, shorter lifespan, shallower discharge
- Best for: Budget builds, stationary use

*Golf Cart Batteries:*

- Pros: Cheap, readily available, proven for off-grid
- Cons: Heavy, require ventilation, regular maintenance
- Best for: Low-budget builds with limited mobility needs

**Sizing:**

- Calculate daily power consumption
- Multiply by days of autonomy needed (2-3 days typical)
- Account for depth of discharge limits
- Add 20% safety margin

### Inverters

**Pure Sine Wave Required:**

- Essential for sensitive electronics
- Medical equipment compatibility
- Computer and phone charging
- Motors run more efficiently

**Sizing:**

- Calculate maximum simultaneous load
- Add surge capacity for motor starting (2-3x running watts)
- Multiple smaller inverters can be better than one large
- Consider split voltage (120V and 240V if needed)

**Features to Look For:**

- Automatic low-voltage cutoff (protects batteries)
- Overload protection
- Remote monitoring capability
- Temperature compensation

### Charge Controllers

**MPPT vs. PWM:**

- **MPPT:** More efficient (20-30% better), worth the cost for larger systems
- **PWM:** Cheaper, fine for small simple systems

**Sizing:**

- Must handle total solar array current
- Add 25% safety margin
- Consider temperature derating
- Multiple controllers for solar and wind

## Closing Thoughts

A DIY portable microgrid trailer isn’t just about electricity - it’s about **independence, resilience, and community control**. When utilities fail you, when government abandons you, when you’re written off as “not cost-effective” - you can build your own solution.

This is proven technology. People are doing this right now, in rural areas, on reservations, in abandoned communities. You can too.

**Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. Share what you learn.**
